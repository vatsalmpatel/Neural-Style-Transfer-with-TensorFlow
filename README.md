# Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow

Neural Style Transfer is a technique that takes two images, namelt, the `content` image and the `style` image and blend them both together so the output looks like the content image, but ***painted*** in the style of the style reference image. This is implemented with a pre-trained model from`TensorFlow Hub`, that was trained to perform this kind of task. We just need to load the model and use the model to perform style transfer. 

⏩ The results from the neural style transfer are in the notebook itself, just have a look and admire how good of a painter 🎨🖌 I am.

# How to run the notebook ❓

You can create a new anaconda environment like so,

```Bash
conda create -n new_env_name
```

After creating the new environment, we need to activate it:

```Bash
conda activate new_env_name
```

Now, you need to install all the dependencies using the ```requirements.txt``` file:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### And there you have it, you just become a painter with the help of Machine Learning, ENJOY 🎇✅🏁.
